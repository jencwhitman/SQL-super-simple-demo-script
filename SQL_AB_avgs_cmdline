/* In case you care where these data came from: 
A description of the relevant experiment including links to the data
posted on figshare is publicly available at https://psyarxiv.com/8br26/ 
Briefly, the experiment compared visual attention to 
climate-related vs. neutral words within rapidly presented streams 
of visual stimuli. Accuracies are lowest at short lags between 
quickly presented visual 'targets', thus the lower accuracies. 
The climate-related words were more salient and easier for the 
participants to report accurately, relative to neutral words (e.g. 'table'). */

/* Anyway, about SQL:
The commands below were executed from sqlite3 command prompt, 
calculating average accuracies from a csv file
with one row per participant. */

/* If we wanted to group by gender and look at a narrow age range, we could do this.
This is just for the sake of demonstrating SQL skills, not for any real scientific motive.
There isn't much reason to expect a difference by gender except that left vs. right 
political orientation and concern about climate change vary a bit with gender, which 
would affect attention to climate-related words. Age is more likely to matter, because
of how visual processing speed changes with age, although there isn't much variability 
within this sample of undergraduate university students anyway. */
